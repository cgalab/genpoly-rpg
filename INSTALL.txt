# BUILD RPG

This software uses cmake as build system. In order to build 'rpg' you may
want to run the following commands:

     cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
     make
     (make install)

Then you will find the executable file in src/.

However, cmake provides lots of additional options. E.g., by replacing
"CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release" with "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" you will get
a version with debugging support.
